# Readme_Generator
    
    ## Description of Project
    This is an application that takes user input from the terminal (using inquirer package) and converts their answers to the questions asked in to a README.md file. I am using it right now to write the README I am going to submit alongside this homework assignment!

    ## Languages used
    Primarily written in Javascript using Node.JS with some assistance from the Inquirer and FS package (inquirer for prompts in terminal and FS to write the file)

    ## Meet the developers
