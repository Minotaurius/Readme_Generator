# Readme_Generator
    
    ## Description of Project
    This is an application that will ask users questions via their terminal and will take their answers and use them to write a README.md file. I am using it right now to write the README for this homework :)

    ## Languages used
    Primarily used JS to write the code (node.js) with assistance from Inquirer package (for prompts) and FS to write the README itself using the users input.
